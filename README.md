🌊 Adaptive Horde

Dynamic mob hordes that scale with your power

📖 Overview
Adaptive Horde is a server-side mod that brings true progression-based difficulty to Minecraft. Instead of relying on arbitrary day counts or manual difficulty settings, the mod analyzes each player's gear and dynamically spawns hordes of mobs that match their power level.
The better your equipment, the stronger and more numerous the enemies become. No more steamrolling through the night once you get diamond armor - the world fights back!
